# Advent of Code 2024 - My attempt :)

>*Disclaimer:*
>
>*This repository is only for personal/teaching use, the solutions you can find here were written for the puzzles made by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz) for his amazing yearly online event: [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). You can find all the original tasks and all the informations about the event [here](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about).*


In this repository you will find my code implementation that I used to solve all the puzzles and all the input files in ".txt" format [here](https://github.com/Nebus01/Advent-of-Code-2024). Everything was done in Python using VS Code.

Each day there is a problem to solve (Part 1 and Part 2), you will find a folder for each day with the code to solve it and the input files.
